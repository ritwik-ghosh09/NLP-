## Evolutionary Text Generator

The core data generation engine synthesises instruction–response pairs through a multi-generational evolutionary loop inspired by genetic algorithms, combined with LLM-as-judge selection pressure.

### Pipeline Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="generator.svg" alt="Evolutionary Generator Workflow" width="700"/>
</p>

The high-level data flow follows this sequence:

<p align="center">
  <img src="navigator_agent_augment_data_flow.png" alt="Navigator Agent Data Flow" width="700"/>
</p>

### Generational Loop

For each input context passage, the generator runs the following evolutionary cycle across multiple generations (default: 3):

1. **Initial Population Seeding** — Generate `population_size` (default: 5) candidate texts from the source context via the LLM.

2. **Mutation** — Each candidate is stochastically mutated (controlled by `mutation_rate`, default: 0.5) using a mutation prompt that instructs the LLM to rewrite the text with varied phrasing and structure while preserving meaning.

3. **Complexity Measurement** — Each candidate is scored on a 1–5 scale by the LLM, assessing:
   - Language difficulty
   - Concept density
   - Assumed prior knowledge
   
   A `complexity_target` (default: 3) penalises candidates that deviate from the desired complexity level.

4. **Quality Filtering** — A strict LLM-as-judge gate evaluates each candidate for conciseness, clarity, and alignment with the source context. If all candidates are filtered out, a relaxed filter is applied as fallback. If that also yields nothing, the original unfiltered population is used.

5. **Relative Ranking** — Surviving candidates are ranked via pairwise LLM comparison. The LLM assigns ordinal ranks, which are converted to proportional scores:
   ```
   score = (N - rank + 1) / N × 100
   ```

6. **Complexity-Adjusted Ranking** — Raw ranks are adjusted by complexity distance from the target:
   ```
   adjusted_rank = rank + |complexity - target|
   ```

7. **Diverse Selection** — The next generation's population is formed through:
   - **Elite selection**: Top-ranked candidates are preserved directly
   - **Stratified random sampling**: Remaining slots are filled by sampling across rank groups to maintain diversity

After the final generation, a last ranking pass selects the single best candidate as the output.

### AI-Align-AI Refinement

When `use_aaa=True`, the best evolutionary output undergoes a three-stage refinement:

1. **Co-Teaching** — Multiple secondary LLMs (`co_teach_llms`) independently improve the text. The primary LLM selects the best co-teaching variant.
2. **Self-Teaching** — The primary LLM generates improvement suggestions, then incorporates them into a refined version.
3. **Final Selection** — The primary LLM chooses among the Original, Co-Teaching, and Self-Teaching versions.

This process is applied independently to both instructions and responses.

### Evaluation and Ranking

The `evaluation_utils.py` module provides two evaluation mechanisms:

**Absolute Scoring** (`evaluate_texts`) — Each text is scored 0–100 on six metrics:

| Metric | Weight | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Quality | 1.0 | Higher is better |
| Relevance | 1.0 | Higher is better |
| Factual Accuracy | 2.0 | Higher is better |
| Prompt Adherence | 1.0 | Higher is better |
| Bias | 1.0 | Lower is better (inverse) |
| Toxicity | 1.0 | Lower is better (inverse) |

The composite score is computed as a weighted average:

$$S = \frac{\sum s_i \cdot w_i}{\sum w_i}$$

where inverse metrics use $(100 - s_i)$.

**Relative Ranking** (`relative_ranking`) — All candidates are compared head-to-head by the LLM judge, producing ordinal ranks converted to proportional scores.

## Instruction Fine-Tuning

### Dataset

The evolutionarily generated dataset is hosted on HuggingFace:

> **[`ritwik-ghosh/SMT_Fine-tuning_dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ritwik-ghosh/SMT_Fine-tuning_dataset)**

- **639 total samples** with fields: `Context`, `instruction`, `response`
- Samples exceeding 8,000 characters are removed as outliers
- Split: **80% train / 20% test** (seed=42)
- Prompt format uses the Alpaca template with optional context:

```
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{instruction}

### Input:
{context}

### Response:
{response}
```

### QLoRA Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Model | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` |
| Quantisation | 4-bit NF4 with double quantisation |
| Compute dtype | `bfloat16` |
| LoRA rank (`r`) | 16 |
| LoRA alpha (`lora_alpha`) | 32 |
| LoRA dropout | 0.05 |
| Bias | None |
| Task type | `CAUSAL_LM` |

### Training Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Batch size (per device) | 2 |
| Gradient accumulation steps | 2 |
| Effective batch size | 4 |
| Learning rate | 2e-4 |
| Optimiser | `paged_adamw_8bit` |
| Precision | FP16 |
| Epochs | 3 |
| Max steps | 500 |
| Trainer | `SFTTrainer` (TRL) |

### Training Logs

The training was tracked with Weights & Biases. Key curves:

#### Training Loss
<p align="center">
  <img src="train_loss_square.png" alt="Training Loss" width="500"/>
</p>

Training loss decreased from ~2.35 to ~1.85 over 5k steps, showing steady convergence with typical noise from the small effective batch size.

#### Evaluation Loss
<p align="center">
  <img src="eval_loss_sq.png" alt="Evaluation Loss" width="500"/>
</p>

Evaluation loss dropped sharply in the first 1k steps (2.30 → 1.90) and plateaued around 1.87, indicating good generalisation with no sign of overfitting.

#### Learning Rate Schedule
<p align="center">
  <img src="learning_rate_sq.png" alt="Learning Rate" width="500"/>
</p>

A linear decay schedule from 2e-4 to 0, providing aggressive early learning followed by fine-grained refinement.

#### Gradient Norm
<p align="center">
  <img src="grad_norm_sq.png" alt="Gradient Norm" width="500"/>
</p>

Gradient norms remained largely stable (0.8–1.5) with occasional spikes up to ~3.8, consistent with the varied sequence lengths in the SMT dataset.

## Evaluation

The fine-tuned model is evaluated against the base Qwen 2.5 0.5B using an **LLM-as-judge** framework with six SMT-domain-specific metrics, scored on 50 held-out test samples:

<p align="center">
  <img src="evaluated_metric_results.png" alt="Evaluation Results" width="700"/>
</p>

| Metric | Base Model | Fine-Tuned | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Factuality (weight 2×) | 56.1 | 64.3 | +8.2 (+14.5%) |
| Technical Accuracy | 56.6 | 61.9 | +5.3 (+9.4%) |
| Completeness | 56.9 | 61.4 | +4.5 (+8.0%) |
| Process Workflow Knowledge | 36.4 | 43.7 | +7.3 (+20.1%) |
| Advanced Research Reasoning | 34.9 | 46.9 | +12.0 (+34.4%) |
| Clarity | 54.6 | 62.6 | +8.0 (+14.6%) |
| **Composite Score** | **50.2** | **57.9** | **+7.6 (+15.2%)** |

The fine-tuned model outperformed the base in **35 out of 50** test samples. The largest relative gains were in Advanced Research Reasoning (+34.4%) and Process Workflow Knowledge (+20.1%).

The evaluation notebook (`Evaluation.ipynb`) supports both **OpenAI** and **Ollama** as LLM judge providers, configurable via a single variable.
