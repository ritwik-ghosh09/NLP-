Specifically, varying Zn content can lead to the formation of new interfacial compounds at the Sn–Bi/Cu interface, which alters the dynamics of the intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. This is crucial because the Cu–Sn IMC can negatively impact the reliability of solder joints. By incorporating Zn, the mutual diffusion between Sn and Cu atoms is inhibited, which reduces the consumption of the Cu substrate and extends its service life.\n",

By monitoring the dynamic contact angle and the equivalent spreading area simultaneously, researchers can gain insights into how the presence of Zn modifies the wetting kinetics.

Specifically, varying Zn content can alter the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the solder/Cu interface. When Zn is incorporated into the Sn–Bi alloy, it can react with Cu to form new interfacial compounds, which can inhibit the mutual diffusion between Sn and Cu atoms. This reduction in diffusion helps to minimize the consumption of the Cu substrate, thereby prolonging its service life. \n",

As the Zn content varies, it affects the wettability of the Sn–Bi solder on the Cu substrate. The dynamic contact angle, which reflects the ability of the solder to spread on the substrate, can change as a function of time and Zn concentration. By monitoring the dynamic contact angle and the equivalent spreading area simultaneously, researchers can gain insights into how the presence of Zn modifies the wetting kinetics. This includes understanding the rate at which the solder spreads and how quickly it reaches a stable wetting state, which is crucial for optimizing soldering processes in manufacturing.\n",

The presence of varying Zn content can lead to notable changes in the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the solder/Cu interface. Specifically, when Zn is added to the Sn–Bi alloy, it can react with Cu to form new interfacial compounds. This reaction is crucial because it inhibits the mutual diffusion between Sn and Cu atoms, which is a common issue that can lead to the degradation of the Cu substrate. By reducing this diffusion, the consumption of the Cu substrate is minimized, thereby extending its service life and enhancing the reliability of the solder joint.\n",

The modification of the microstructure due to Zn incorporation can lead to improved ductility, making the solder less susceptible to brittle fracture. This is particularly advantageous under mechanical stress conditions, where traditional Sn–Bi solders may fail due to their inherent brittleness. Thus, the strategic addition of Zn not only improves the mechanical integrity of the solder but also addresses one of the critical limitations of Bi-containing solders.\n",

As Zn content varies, it affects the wettability characteristics of the Sn–Bi solder on the Cu substrate. The dynamic contact angle, which indicates the solder's ability to spread on the substrate, is influenced by the concentration of Zn and can change over time. By employing a dual-camera system to monitor the dynamic contact angle and the equivalent spreading area simultaneously, researchers can gain valuable insights into how Zn alters the wetting kinetics. This includes understanding the rate at which the solder spreads and the time it takes to reach a stable wetting state, which is critical for optimizing soldering processes in industrial applications.\n",

      "2. (4.00) The incorporation of zinc (Zn) into Sn–Bi solder significantly impacts both its wettability and interfacial reactions when applied to a copper (Cu) substrate. The presence of varying Zn content can lead to notable changes in the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the solder/Cu interface. Specifically, when Zn is added to the Sn–Bi alloy, it can react with Cu to form new interfacial compounds. This reaction is crucial because it inhibits the mutual diffusion between Sn and Cu atoms, which is a common issue that can lead to the degradation of the Cu substrate. By reducing this diffusion, the consumption of the Cu substrate is minimized, thereby extending its service life and enhancing the reliability of the solder joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a mechanical properties perspective, the addition of Zn to Sn–Bi solder can enhance its overall performance. The modification of the microstructure due to Zn incorporation can lead to improved ductility, making the solder less susceptible to brittle fracture. This is particularly advantageous under mechanical stress conditions, where traditional Sn–Bi solders may fail due to their inherent brittleness. Thus, the strategic addition of Zn not only improves the mechanical integrity of the solder but also addresses one of the critical limitations of Bi-containing solders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of dynamic wetting processes, the addition of Zn influences the relationship between the dynamic contact angle and the spreading area over time. As Zn content varies, it affects the wettability characteristics of the Sn–Bi solder on the Cu substrate. The dynamic contact angle, which indicates the solder's ability to spread on the substrate, is influenced by the concentration of Zn and can change over time. By employing a dual-camera system to monitor the dynamic contact angle and the equivalent spreading area simultaneously, researchers can gain valuable insights into how Zn alters the wetting kinetics. This includes understanding the rate at which the solder spreads and the time it takes to reach a stable wetting state, which is critical for optimizing soldering processes in industrial applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, varying the Zn content in Sn–Bi solder has profound effects on its wettability and interfacial reactions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and improved reliability of solder joints on Cu substrates. The interplay between Zn content, dynamic wetting behavior, and interfacial compound formation is essential for advancing the performance of lead-free solders in electronic applications.\n",
